# cheque-validation-using-image-processing

In this project, we proposed a system which validates the cheque by retrieving details like 
Payee name, Amount (in words as well as in digits), date, bank details using optical character recognition (OCR) 
and verifies the signature on cheque with the image stored in local system.
